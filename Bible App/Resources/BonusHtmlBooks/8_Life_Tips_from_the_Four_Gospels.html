<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>8 Life
Tips from the Four Gospels</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Four Gospels are filled with many life
lessons. Far more lessons than can be sufficiently covered here. But, within
these four books, there are many core character traits that can be observed and
applied to our daily lives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Dishonesty does not have to define you. 
     There are many times that people say, ¨Well, you know what he did way back
     then….¨ Matthew is an excellent example of what it means to turn one's
     life around.  Initially, Matthew was a sketchy Jewish tax-collector.  He
     gave up his dishonest ways and became Christ's disciple.  Throughout his
     book, readers learn a lot about money.  Matthew turned from his dishonest
     ways and wanted everyone to know that Jesus is the Messiah.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Stay strong!  Mark wrote one of the four
     gospels.  He wanted his love and adoration for Christ to be the focal
     point for his writing.  Mark recorded Jesus´ life and ministry.  Mark
     remained faithful even when things were tough.  Mark 11:23:  ¨<span
     style='background:white'>Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this
     mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his
     heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done
     for him.¨</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Be healed.  Luke wanted everyone to be a
     part of Christ's family and be healed of their sins.  As a physician, Luke
     wrote about the life and ministry of Jesus for non-Jewish readers.  He
     wanted everyone to know that this was the Messiah who had been promised. 
     Throughout these chapters, one´s heart can be changed. </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Be unique and be bold.  John takes a unique
     perspective by showing us a view of Jesus from Heaven down.  There were
     many signs and symbols that illustrate how Jesus is the Messiah.  Mark
     11:23:  ¨<span style='background:white'>Truly, I say to you, whoever says
     to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not
     doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it
     will be done for him.¨</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Be compassionate.  In John 11, Jesus showed
     compassion at Lazarus´ grave.  He saw Lazarus´ friends weeping, and He
     wept alongside them.  Throughout the gospels, Jesus Christ felt compassion
     towards people, both comforting and healing them.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Sometimes there is no explanation.  In all
     four gospels, the feeding of the 5,000 appears.  This miracle is found in
     Matthew 14; Mark 6; Luke 9; and John 6.  When it cannot be explained, just
     smile and say ¨thank you, Jesus¨.  It did not make sense how Jesus was
     able to take two tiny fish and two loaves of bread and feed thousands of
     people.  There are miracles from Jesus that occur in humans´ lives daily. 
     </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=7 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Have faith.  Throughout the four gospels, readers
     witness miracles over and over again.  We walk by faith not by sight.  In
     doing so, we express our faith and allow it to take us to new heights. 
     From the woman who simply wanted to touch Jesus’ garment to the little boy
     with his fishes, having faith shows that we trust Jesus to direct our
     lives and take care of us.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=8 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Be teachable.  In reading the parables
     throughout the Four Gospels, readers can see amazing stories about how we
     should plant His Word in good soil and remain tillable.  When we become
     harsh and critical, our seeds can fall into spaces they cannot grow new
     Christians for His Kingdom.  Never lose a willingness to learn from life. 
     </span></li>
