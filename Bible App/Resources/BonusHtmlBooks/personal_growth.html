style='color:#500050;background:white'>Five Characteristics of Personal Growth</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Personal growth is about taking steps to
develop your mind, your health, and your spirituality. Let’s take a look at
five components of personal growth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Find the seed. What inspires you? What
     appears to be your destiny? God created you because He needed someone
     exactly like you on this earth. Pray for direction in how to channel the
     seed of your destiny from within. Strive to seek God’s direction and
     allow Him to lead you down different paths to grow, develop, and refine
     that seed. Jeremiah 29:11: “<span style='background:white'>For I know
     the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and
     not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Take responsibility.  God wants us to take
     responsibility.  Part of responsibility means that we have to be able and
     willing to accept the free will He has given us and still make healthy
     choices.  Personal growth is reflected through the choice to do the right
     thing.  Act and respond in a way that reflects Christian wisdom and leads
     to others’ benefit.  Personal growth is shown in individuals who are able
     to give more and take less.   Ezra 10:4: “<span style='background:white'>Arise,
     for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and do it.”</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Give to others.  The way we pour into other
     people’s lives is a reflection of how we support and give to others.  Now,
     the five languages could easily be applied here.  There are multiple ways
     to give to people.  Physical gifts, kind words, acts of service, a warm
     smile or a tender hug, and quality time all represent products of personal
     growth.  Find ways to give more than you take and you will see your own
     self-worth and fulfillment growing within your Christian walk.  2
     Corinthians 9:6-8:  “<span style='color:#222222;background:white'>Remember
     this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows
     generously will also reap generously. Each of you should <b>give</b> what
     you have decided in your heart to <b>give</b>, not reluctantly or under
     compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Be positive.  Create a positive mindset. 
     This is reflective of personal growth and creates a metaphorical basket to
     hold God’s blessings.  Counting one’s blessings and walking a life of
     optimism is a sign of personal growth.  Psalm 34:8: “<span
     style='background:white'>Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is
     the one who takes refuge in him.”</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Be a faith builder.  When we have a favorable
     outlook on life and share that perspective with other people, we are
     showing other people that we believe in the power of positivity.  
     Galatians 6:2:  “<b><span style='background:white'> </span></b><span
     style='background:white'>Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you
     will fulfill the law of Christ.’</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>These five components may not reflect typical
personal growth, but each of these suggestions reflects confidence in Christ
and a desire to be a stronger, more faith driven individual.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='color:#222222;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='color:#222222;background:white'>Hebrews
11:1 “Now <b>faith</b> is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of
things not seen.”</span></p>
