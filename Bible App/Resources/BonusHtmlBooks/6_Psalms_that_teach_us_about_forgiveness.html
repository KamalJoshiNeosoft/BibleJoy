Psalms that Teach Us About Forgiveness</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Forgiveness is no easy task, but the benefits of it are very favorable.  When we choose to forgive someone, we are not just just giving them a ‘get off the hook’ card so to speak. Instead,
we are giving ourselves permission to move on. There have likely been people
in your life who have hurt you and never asked for forgiveness. Those examples
illustrate why we must move on and choose to forgive anyway. When we choose to
forgive someone, we are freeing ourselves from the bondage that unforgiveness
has on us. The decision to readmit someone to our lives following forgiveness
is a different decision; nonetheless, choosing to forgive is a means of
addressing your inner pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>            God wants us to forgive others,
but He also wants us to seek forgiveness from our own sins and shortcomings. 
This can be just as hard as forgiving someone else.  We must be willing to be
very open and transparent with God.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>            In the following sections, I would
like to share six Psalms that teach us about forgiveness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Psalm 32 - Confess your sin</span></b><span
     lang=EN>.  “Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my
     iniquity. I said, ‘I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.’ And you
     forgave the guilt of my sin” - Psalm 32:5.  In this Psalm, wwe see the
     importance of confessing our sin and asking for forgiveness for those
     sins.  When we confess our sins, He is just to forgive us.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Psalm 40 - Thank Him for forgiveness.  </span></b><span
     lang=EN>In Psalm 40, verses 2 &amp; 3 state: “He lifted me out of the
     slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a
     firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to
     our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in Him.” This
     psalm reminds us that forgiving others is an important part of what we are
     asked and expected to do as Christians.  Read Matthew 18 to gain even more
     insights into Christ’s teachings about forgiving others. In this specific
     Psalm, we catch a glimpse of David praising God for forgiveness.  When we
     choose to let go of unforgiveness, we are preventing it from becoming sin
     in our own lives.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Psalm 103 - Unconditional love and
     forgiveness</span></b><span lang=EN>.  “As far as the east is from the
     west, so far as he removed our transgression from us.”  There is no sin
     too big for God.  He is able to clean up the vilest sinner and transform
     them into a new person living a clean life focused on God.  This Psalm is
     a poetic celebration of God’s love for us.  He is a compassionate Father
     who loves us unconditionally.  We have complete forgiveness because of the
     good, good Father He is.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Psalm 25 - No sin is too big</span></b><span
     lang=EN>.  “For the sake of your name, Lord, forgive my iniquity, though
     it is great.”  There are no sins too big or too bad to bring before the
     cross.  This verse from the twenty-fifth Psalm conveys David’s praise
     towards God and then His willingness to ask forgiveness from His sins. 
     Readers of this Psalm will see a very open David confessing his
     wickedness.  Being willing to confess our sins before God is a sign that
     we want forgiveness and are actively seeking it. </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Psalm 51 - Take Ownership for your Sin</span></b><span
     lang=EN>.  In Psalm 51 it states: “You do not delight in sacrifice, or I
     would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings. My sacrifice,
     O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not
     despise.” God had to acknowledge some major guilt following his affair
     with Bathsheba and the subsequent murdering of her husband/his friend,
     Uriah.  When confronted about his sin, David was honest and willing to
     confess it before God.  This example shows how we must take ownership of
     our sin.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Psalm 130:3-4 states: “If you, Lord, kept a
record of sins, Lord, who could stand?”  Thankfully, friend, He does not keep a
record.  He forgives us and for that we should give reverence and serve Him!  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>May these Psalms give you direction and
purpose on your own path to seeking forgiveness.  </span></p>
