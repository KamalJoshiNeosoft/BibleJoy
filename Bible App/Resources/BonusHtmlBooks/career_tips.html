<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='color:#222222;background:white'>More
people than ever before are unemployed. The world is looking for hope,
answers, and solutions that may seem overwhelming.  Even during a time when so
many people are unemployed, God’s promise to help us is authentic and very
real.  </span></p>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222'><span lang=EN style='background:
     white'>Pray through your situation.  Are you unemployed?  Employed in a
     job that you took only because there was nothing else available?  Are you
     suddenly finding yourself unfulfilled in your job or sick of working from
     home?  God does not promise that we will get exactly what we pray for, but
     as Christians, we are called to a life of prayer.  Lift your burdens up to
     the Lord and watch Him work.  It may not be in that hour or even that day,
     but His word promises in Luke 12:24:  “Consider the ravens: they neither
     sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds
     them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!”</span></li>

     Seeking answers about where to look for jobs or how to apply can be
     simplified when we tap into other resources.  </span></li>
