<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span lang=EN>How
to Stay Connected to God in a Hectic World</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>For weeks and in some cases,
months, our daily lives seem to come to an abrupt halt. Now that life is
slowly resuming to its regular pace, you may be wondering how you can stay
connected to God. Here are four tips to help you see and feel God even in the
most rushed circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN> Don't overlook nature.</span></b><span
     lang=EN>  One of the ways that I always feel the closest to God is by
     looking at the things He has created.  Trees, flowers, streams, mountains,
     and the list goes on.  I always feel like I am looking at God when I truly
     take time to admire these simple treasures.  In Chapters 1 and 2 of
     Genesis, we are presented with the story of God's work to create these
     treasures.  I truly believe that when we are willing to pause and reflect
     on the things surrounding us that are not man made, we get a firsthand
     glimpse of God.  At that time, we may feel compelled to pray or have
     conversation with God.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN> <b>Start the day with God before you truly
     start the day.</b>  Even if you are not a morning person, waking up a
     little early to listen to a podcast, study from the Bible, or meditate on
     your daily devotion, creating a routine that begins with God is invaluable
     in allowing Him to frame your day.  By taking time to study God's word at
     the beginning of the day, you are declaring it to be the most important
     aspect of your life.  As this process continues, it becomes more and more
     obvious why He deserves those initial moments.  Hebrews 4:12 states, ¨For
     the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword,
     piercing to the division of soup and spirit, of joints and marrow, and
     discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart¨.  Make your intention
     to start your day with Him!</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN> In Exodus 33:14, the Bible says, ¨And he
     said, ¨My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.¨  <b>This
     verse means that He is always with us </b>- there is no reason that you
     cannot talk with God during the most hectic or stressful times of your
     day.  He is with you in the stressful work meeting.  He is with you during
     the lonely part of the day when you leave your children at school or
     daycare.  His presence is forever, and this allows us to know that our
     relationship with Him is natural.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN> <b>Don't try to force it.</b>  As humans,
     sometimes we try too hard, but God does not want us to feel pressured or
     even more rushed because we are trying to take more time for Him.  In
     fact, He wants our relationship with Him to be natural.  One of the best
     ways to know He is with us during a hectic day is simply to acknowledge
     the genuine nature of His love.  Proverbs 18:24 reminds us, ¨A man that
     hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that
     sticketh closer than a brother¨.  This friend does not get upset when we
     fail to say good morning or we forget their child's soccer game.  God is
     that friend who stands closer than a brother.  Allow Him to be your calm
     in the hectic world.  </span></li>
