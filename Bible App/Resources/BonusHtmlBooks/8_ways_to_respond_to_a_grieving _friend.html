<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>8 Ways
to Respond to a Grieving Friend</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>When we see people we love hurting, our natural response is to want to help. When friends are grieving
the loss of a loved one, the natural question is: what can I do to help?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Psalm 23 is a beautiful scripture that many of
us can likely quote word for word….¨The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want,
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside the still water,
He restores my soul, He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's
sake, Even though I will walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil, for you are with me, your rod and your staff….they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me in presence of my enemies, You anoint my head
with oil, my cup overflows, Surely goodness and love with follow me all the
days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever…..¨</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Within this scripture are some words and
actions that we can heed to help a friend who is grieving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN> Sometimes we want to be there for that
     person and there is a time and place for that, but they may also need time
     and space.  Don´t push yourself on them, but also don't be offended if
     they can´t talk, respond to your messages, or answer the door when you
     knock.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Pray for your friend.  Pray for them my name
     and ask the Lord to be near to them.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Remind your friend that they belong to
     someone who has overcome death and the grave.  A gentle reminder that a
     reunion with loved ones who have passed is certain.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Point them to Jesus.  If your friend is a
     Christian, this is obviously easier, but even if they are not, find ways
     to direct them to God without seeming too preachy or pushy.  Let them see
     Jesus in you.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Give them permission to grieve.  Depending
     on how close you are to the friend, you may be there when they have their
     biggest meltdown or not.  They may make comments about needing to be okay
     and being unable to cry.  Giving them the freedom to cry and grieve is a
     useful tool during this process.  Remind them that God wants us to bring
     our burdens before Him.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>When the time is right, invite your friend
     to dinner.  Allow them to know up front that there is no pressure and no
     obligation to accept.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=7 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Let them lead the conversation.  When
     someone we know has passed away, it is natural for us to try to make that
     the center of conversation or to do the exact opposite and avoid that
     person's name at all costs.  Your friend who is grieving may want to
     recount memories of their loved one, or they may simply need to set their
     grief to the side for the time being and live the moment.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=8 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Remind yourself and your friend that grief
     comes in waves.  Your friend may not understand why they are standing
     strong and laughing one minute and then crying uncontrollably the next.
     This is the cycle of grief, and moments may change into days, but the bad
     moments can still creep in unexpectedly.  Offer reassurance that this is
     normal.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>As you go into the valley of grief with your
friend, remember that you cannot feel what they feel.  You may have had a
similar experience in the past, but your distance from that moment may make
your response different from their immediate one.  Use this opportunity to
practice 1 Peter 5:7:  ¨Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.¨</span></p>
