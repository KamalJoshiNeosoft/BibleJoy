<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN
style='background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:white'>Doing God’s work from home may seem difficult, but there are options. Consider these four different ways to reach out from the comfort of your home and potentially make a big impact on your friends, neighbors, and community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN style='background:
white'>Social media has become a very effective communication tool. If you use
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or another form of social media, harness the
opportunity to spread positive messages. The world is looking for hope and all
too often social media is filled with grim news. Posts do not have to be
lengthy or detailed, but share a favorite Bible verse.  Add a story about how
God pulled you through a difficult time or how you received unexpected
blessings.  These posts may become the highlight of someone’s day!  Psalm 96:3
says:  “Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the
peoples!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:white'>Be kind!
Building relationships even with people from afar can have a huge impact.  When
walking outside or doing yard work, extend a smile and a wave when people
pass.  While you may not be having direct contact with the people who pass, you
are showing Christ’s love by extending warmth to those who see you.  This may
seem simple, but it can be a powerful way to do God’s work from home. 
Galatians 6:10:  “So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone,
and especially to those who are of the household of faith.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:white'>Offer to
lend a helping hand.  Similar to being kind, offering to lend a helping hand to
neighbors is another effective way to do God’s work.  Raking leaves, mowing the
lawn, helping a neighbor who is completing some minor repairs….all of these
tasks present opportunities to build relationships and be a witness for God. 
The conversations held during these times may be brief or not about Biblical
topics at all, but they are still important in treating others the way we want
to be treated.  Matthew 5:16:   “In the same way, let your light shine before
others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:white'>Use the
kitchen to serve others.  The kitchen can be a powerful tool.  Baked items,
simple casseroles, or other meal ideas can be created and passed out to people
in need.  Use some basic ingredients, add some love, and find people who can
benefit from an outpouring of love.  This simple gesture can be a concrete
example of using simple means to spread a much bigger message.  Proverbs
19:17:  “<span style='color:#272727'>Whoever is generous to the poor lends to
the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed. – Proverbs 19:17”</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='color:#272727;background:white'>            </span><span
lang=EN style='background:white'>Each of these actions may seem simple...they
may seem unable to create change, but each one can be linked to God’s
instruction. Start today - do God’s work from home!  </span></p>
