<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>Maintaining a positive attitude can be hard. You have a flat tire. The drive thru gives
you someone’s else’s order. You arrive ten minutes late to an important
meeting. These negative occurrences are just some of the ways that our days
can be turned into disarray, but when things like this (or much much worse)
happen, we can keep our eyes on Christ. In doing this, we can stay focused
with a positive perspective. </span></p>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><span lang=EN> <b>Perspective
     is everything.</b>  There have been times in my life when I have just felt
     grumpy!  G-R-U-M-P-Y, and I quickly realized something.  The longer I was
     determined to feel sad, pouty, or just not cheerful, my day’s events
     followed that pattern.  Proverbs 15:13 states:  “<span style='background:
     white'>A glad heart makes a cheerful face, but by sorrow of heart the
     spirit is crushed.” </span></span><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
     background:white'> </span><span lang=EN>Look up and know that you belong
     to the One who Created you.  That within itself is a powerful reminder as
     to why we need to focus intentionally on positivity.</span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>Things
     can always be worse.</span></b><span lang=EN>  When I think of Job, he
     went from having an abundance to having nothing.  Then he was blessed with
     double the bounty.  He could have allowed himself to become a miserable
     man.  Honestly, he could have still resented the things and people he lost
     even when he regained double, but he didn’t.  In reality, things can
     always be worse.  I understand that in the middle of tragedy or immense
     loss, it may not feel this way, but during those times push into God and
     His Word. </span></li>

     Proverbs 17:22 states:  “<span style='background:white'>A joyful heart is
     good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.”  </span>When I am
     having a bad day, I can be quick to snap at my children, my colleagues,
     and even complete strangers.  But, when I do this, I am not presenting my
     Christlike values so others can see them.  Don’t get me wrong - we all
     have bad days, but when we choose to stay in the miry pit, we choose to
     diminish the blessings that we can provide to others.  </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>Do
     something to help someone! </span></b><span lang=EN> When life isn’t going
     as you would like, find a way to be a blessing to someone else.  Maybe
     this won’t fix your circumstances, but doing something nice for someone
     will certainly brighten their day.  I  have found that these random acts
     of kindness typically do as much (if not more) for me as they do for the
     other person.  It might not be easy to act this way when you are down and
     out, but give it a try!  Luke 6:27 reminds us:</span><span lang=EN
     style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:115%;color:#443122'> “But love your
     enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your
     reward will be great.”</span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>You
     are Redeemed!  </span></b><span lang=EN>If you are a child of God, no one
     can take that away from you.  On the worst of days, you are His!  On the
     best of days, you are His!  Nothing can distance you from His love.  There
     are no depths too far for Him to reach.  This alone is worthy of our
     praises and should empower us to reach for the positivity even when it
     seems hardest.  Galatians 2:20 states:  “<span style='background:white'>I
     have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ
     who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in
     the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”</span></span></li>
