Ways to Deal with Conflict in the Workplace</span></p>

font-family:Roboto;background:white'>Working alongside someone
means they see you at your best, your worst, and many other times in between. 
There are times that co-workers share laughter, deep discussions, or joy-filled
celebrations. Nonetheless, there are other times that stress replaces unity
and civility. How can someone deal with conflict in the workplace while
continuing to display Christlike attributes?</span></p>

     style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;background:
     white'>  When our emotions are at their highest level, it is best to walk
     away.  Go for a walk.  Go back inside your office or remain quiet. 
     Speaking from one’s most emotional state can lead to saying harsh things
     that are not how we will really feel in hours (or even minutes) later. 
     “Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will
     eat its fruits” (Proverbs 18:21). </span></li>

     style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;background:
     white'>  It is always a good idea to pray when stress is involved.  Pray
     for discernment.  Pray for wisdom.  Pray for the other people involved in
     the conflict.  Seeking God’s wisdom and assistance in the situation
     removes our carnal limitations.  We are surrendering our inabilities to
     Him.  In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus told us:  “Pray for those who
     persecute you.”  Sometimes we have to accept that our poor decisions lead
     to our own selfish persecutions.  So, don’t get caught up in praying for
     the other person’s thoughts to change.  Pray instead for resolution.  </span></li>

     lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;
     background:white'>  While it may not be immediately clear what the
     resolution to the conflict is, focusing on who is right or who is wrong
     will only intensify the argument.  All too often, we want to think someone
     has to be right or wrong during a conflict.  This should be the least
     important part of conflict resolution.  Work to solve the problem and
     remember that people who like or even love each other still argue at
     times.  In Psalm 141:3, we are reminded to allow the Lord to work through
     our words.  In this case, accept that conflict occurs as a normal part of
     day to day living, but that does not mean anyone has to be labeled as the
     winner of an argument.</span></li>

     still like each other.</span></b><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;
     line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;background:white'>  When we get upset
     with someone, are we able to rationally discuss the conflict?  Or, do we
     immediately attach that person’s value in our lives to the conflict?  Life
     is filled with conflict and while some of those conflicts occur with
     people we do not know, the majority of them occur with people who are very
     dear to us.  Remember this the next time, you find yourself in a conflict
     at work (or anywhere).  A conflict may cause strong emotions or uncomfortableness,
     but it does not mean that the person you ate lunch with yesterday is more
     valuable than the person you are arguing with 24-hours later.  Romans
     14:18 advises, “....Make every effort to do what leads to peace and mutual
     edification.”</span></li>

     style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Roboto;background:
     white'>  Romans 12:18 reads, “If possible, so far as it depends, live
     peaceably with all.”  If the conflict is serious, continue doing what you
     can to maintain civility.  Be a peacemaker and continue praying, working,
     and seeking God’s wisdom.  In doing this, allow Christ’s light and peace
     to radiate from you even during conflicting times.</span></li>
