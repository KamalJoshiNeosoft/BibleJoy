font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;background:white'>The
uncertainty of today’s problems has created a lot of anxiety for people. Our
daily lives are altered and those of us who are planners are unable to create a
clear plan for the future because of so much change. These realities are
generating anxiety in people who may have never felt the unexplainable fear and
tension that comes from anxiety. Even with so much uncertainty, God’s Word
provides us with some practical wisdom to apply during the most difficult of
times.</span></p>

 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;background:white'>Be Still!  These two
     words are powerful.  There are multiple places in the Bible that God
     reminds us to simply be still.  In Psalm 46:10, His Word says:  &quot;Be
     still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will
     be exalted in the earth.&quot;  As humans, we want to fix things - we seek
     answers and try to apply solutions to the day’s problems, but when we do
     this, we are not allowing ourselves to let God take the reins.  Contrary
     to this, when we remember that “the Lord will fight for you; you need only
     to be still” (Exodus 14:14), we are surrendering our lives, our problems,
     and our anxiety to Him.  Rather than rushing about in haste and trying to
     remedy conditions that we really cannot change, we need to apply Psalm
     37:7 and know that He will make a way:  “Be still before the Lord and wait
     patiently for him; fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way,
     over the man who carries out evil devices!”  When anxiety is controlling
     your thoughts, emotions, and driving your fears, find something in nature
     that reminds you of God - a favorite tree, a beautiful flower, or even the
     wind - let this image of His faithfulness remind you of how His control
     far exceeds any anxieties we may have.  </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;background:white'>Talk to God.  In
     nature, I find it is easier to talk with God.  The daily distractions from
     manmade things are removed, and there is a natural tendency to be more
     open with the Creator.  It is during these times that I find it easiest to
     confess my anxieties and worries to Him.  He does not want us to be
     anxious and tells us in Phillippians 4:6-7 that we should come before Him
     in prayer and petition presenting our requests to Him.   Find a place
     where you can pray and allow His peace to become your driving force. </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;background:white'>Trade Worry for
     Wisdom. Anxiety and worry seem to go hand in hand, but how often does
     worry alter a situation?  If we are honest, we know that it only adds
     stress to our day and compounds our anxiety; nonetheless, look inside
     God’s Word and see how He led people through perilous times when they too
     were worried.  The Holy Bible is filled with wisdom about how to deal with
     life’s pressures and when we seek His wisdom, we are reminded that with it
     comes unconditional love and omnipresent companionship.  </span></li>
