<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>5 Tips
to Share Christ with the World</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Matthew 28:19 states, ¨Go ye therefore, and teach all nations….¨This verse is one of the many times that
we are reminded of the need to instruct other people about Christ and His
teachings, but how do we get to this point? There are some common ways we can
share Christ with the world before getting into scripture. Now, you may ask:
why wouldn't I share scripture with people whom I meet?  You certainly can, but
there are times that people need to see Christ in you more than they need to
hear how Christ is in you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Be kind.  Kindness is something that costs
     nothing, but yields great dividends.  Ephesians 4:32 reminds us to ¨Be
     kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in
     Christ, God forgave you.¨  When you are out shopping or at a restaurant
     and witness an employee having a bad attitude, meeting their anger or
     hostility with your own will accomplish nothing.  Instead, be kind.  This
     simple gesture can be a powerful statement that Christ lives within you.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Create relationships.  Some people are more
     resistant to hearing about Christ than others.  One way to tell these
     people about Christ is to build relationships.  If there is a local drug
     addiction shelter in your area or a homeless shelter, see if you can
     donate meals and/or write letters with the residents.  This simple gesture
     can be a way to build relationships.  Through your commitment to build a
     genuine relationship with these individuals, you are already allowing them
     to see Christ's work inside you.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Be set apart.  Romans 12:2 states, ¨And be
     not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your
     mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable, and perfect,
     will of God.¨  Your actions, your words, and your daily life is a living
     testimony of the transforming power of Jesus Christ.  Live a life that
     shows you have been set apart and that is why you make the choices you
     make which are grounded in God's Word.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Pray for opportunity and embrace it when it
     comes.  Colossians 4:5 reads, ¨Be wise in the way you act toward
     outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.¨  This verse teaches us
     that we have limited time to share Christ with the world.  Pray that God
     will place people in your path to share Him with.  When those people are
     in your presence, embrace that opportunity.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Keep it simple.  The Holy Bible is a complex
     book that is meant to challenge us to become stronger, holier people, but
     this is a progressive process that will never be finished until we reach
     Heaven.  When sharing Christ with the world, keep it simple!  Tell them
     about God's peace and life.  Share the problem that comes from being
     separated from God.  Talk about the cross as the ultimate remedy.  Explain
     the response we have thanks to His ultimate sacrifice - praying to receive
     Christ.  </span></li>
</ol>
