Your Child Find Their Identity in Christ</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The world tries hard to throw a
lot at our children. Having a strong identity in Christ can help children
remain focused on the end prize, eternity in Heaven. This identity can also
help children say no to temptations that may come their way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>How can you help your children know who they
are in Christ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Read the Bible with them</span></b><span
     lang=EN>.  Studying the Bible with your child will help them to see that
     it is so much more than just a book.  It is a roap map to provide
     guidance, direction, and examples of how to live life.  Each study session
     will bring them closer to God and farther away from the world.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Pray over them. </span></b><span lang=EN> Choose
     a verse and let that be your prayer for them as they grow and develop into
     young adults.  Consider one of these verses as your prayer:  </span></li>

  <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Ephesians 2:10:  ¨For we are his

  <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>1 Peter 2:9:  ¨But you are a chosen race, a
      royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that
      you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness
      into his marvelous light.¨</span></li>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Remind them that you are there for
     support. </span></b><span lang=EN> This world will attempt to throw a lot
     of stuff at our children.  If we have an open relationship with them, they
     are more open to discussing their problems and concerns with us.  These
     times allow us to direct them to God´s word and away from the world. 
     During these talks point them to verses including Ephesians 4:24: ¨And to
     put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true
     righteousness and holiness.¨</span></li>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Don't try to do it all alone.</span></b><span
     lang=EN>  Look to other trusted adults to pour into your children.  These
     other adults can help your child build their identity in Christ.  They
     will see evidence in their lives and it will be another reinforcement
     about how finding our identity in Him is a wonderful way to stay on the
     straight and narrow path.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Pray with your child</span></b><span
     lang=EN>.  Praying with your child is a powerful change to grow together
     and strengthen your bond, as well as your relationship with God.  Having a
     set prayer time is wonderful, but also take the opportunity to pray with
     them whenever the need arises to seek guidance or to offer up praise.  </span></li>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Help them memorize/post key scriptures.</span></b><span
     lang=EN>  The task of helping your child understand and appreciate their
     identity in Christ may seem overwhelming, but focus on empowering them
     with scripture.  Help them write out key Bible verses and post those
     verses in visible places.  Likewise, you can work with your child to help
     them memorize scriptures such as Jeremiah 1:5: ¨Before I formed you in the
     womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed
     you a prophet to the nations.¨  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Make your goal to empower your child with a
reflection of Christ´s love and presence in their lives.  Help them understand
His omnipotence and unconditional love which will ground them in their
spiritual identity.  </span></p>
