<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>5 Ways
to Enhance Your Prayer Life</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>1 Thessalonians 5:17 says, “Pray without
ceasing.” As busy human beings, running from one task to the next, we tend to
always want to put a period at the end of a task, a sentence, an event, and so
on. But, this simple verse reminds us of something that is anything but
simple. Let’s take a look at 5 ways to enhance your prayer life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN> Forget the Amen. God wants us to talk to
     Him without the period or the Amen.  He wants us to remain in constant
     dialogue with Him about our hopes, our ups and downs, and all the
     seemingly simple things throughout our day. We are quick to text our
     friends about the neat bird we saw during our evening walk or the amazing
     dessert we tried with lunch, but we forget to tell God these simple
     things.  It may seem overdone, but if it is worth sharing with a friend,
     it is certainly worth sharing with the Ultimate Friend, Our Heavenly
     Father.  Thank Him for  His creation - that beautiful bird or the talent
     He gave humans, so they could make our taste buds erupt with glee.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Don’t overcomplicate it.  At different times
     in my life, I have approached prayer in many different ways.  Do you know
     what I always come back to?  It is not meant to be a process that looks
     the same from one time to the next.  It is a conversation with my Heavenly
     Father that may take place while I am driving down the road.  It may be
     while I am walking down the hall at work.  Prayer isn’t meant to be
     complex or overwhelming.  It is meant to be a conversation where we submit
     and acknowledge that He is always with us.  His Word says in Ephesians
     6:18:  “Praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and
     supplication.  To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making
     supplication for all the saints.” </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Find some time for truly focused prayer. 
     While this seems opposite of the first two tips I provided, this
     particular prayer is about the times when you can communicate with God
     free from distraction.  You are able to share your praises and concerns,
     but you are also able to pause and allow Him to speak back to you.  In
     Jeremiah 33:3, His Word reads: “Call to me and I will answer you, and will
     tell you the great and hidden things that you have not known.”   </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Create a prayer wall.  Find a place in your
     home where you can post your prayers.  Have one place designated for
     answered prayers.  Have a different space to post prayers that you are
     waiting for an answer to.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Pay attention to all the answered prayers.
     Pay attention as these unanswered prayers take on new identities when you
     move them to the answered column.  When the answered prayer space becomes
     too crowded, consider placing these in a box or a notebook to look back on
     when you need a reminder of James 5:16:  “The prayer of a righteous person
     has great power as it is working.”    </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:white'>These tips are meant
to help you grow spiritually.  Yes, God does want us to enter into our prayer
closets and communicate with Him using the most intimate parts of ourselves,
but we should also remember that we can pray without ceasing all throughout our
day!  </span></p>
