<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;background:white'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>From
missed opportunities, limited gatherings, and other countless items, we can all
reference multiple things lost to 2020, but have you considered what 2020 gave
you? In a world where things are so different from the norm, it can be
difficult to count our blessings, but, just the same, 2020 provided multiple
things for us to celebrate. Psalms 118 reminds us: ¨<span style='background:
white'>Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his steadfast love
endures forever! Let Israel say, “His steadfast love endures forever.”</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>&nbsp;</span></p>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>More
     time in God's Word.  </span></b><span lang=EN>Simpler schedules brought
     more time to focus on God and His Word.  With no sports practices, no late
     night meetings, and no frantic schedules, people were able to find more
     time to study God's Word.  It is so easy to let our hectic lives distract
     us from His Word, but 2020 gave us an opportunity to slow down, create
     some better study habits, and be ready to take on 2021 armed with His Word
     in our hearts.  </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>More
     family time. </span></b><span lang=EN> 2020 forced everyone to slow down. 
     We were afforded with more time to truly focus on our families.  Hectic
     schedules were replaced with loads of free time.  Free time can be
     difficult for many, but through the vacant planners came more meals around
     the dinner table, more home improvement projects done together, and more
     togetherness.  I am certainly thankful for the bonus family time that 2020
     gave me.  </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>The
     opportunity to try something new.</span></b><span lang=EN>  It is so easy
     to get stuck in a normal routine.  2020 redefined normal, and that
     redefining brought with it some new opportunities.  For example, one thing
     my family and I learned to love were hikes.  Rather than being stuck
     indoors, we took to the forests and found some beautiful natural scenery
     right here near our home.  It is highly likely that we would have never
     had this special time together if 2020 had not forced us to find something
     new to do.  DId I mention that those hiking moments will be special
     memories that we will cherish for the rest of our lives?  </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>An
     emphasis on what really matters.</span></b><span lang=EN>  It is so easy
     to forget what truly matters.  As cliche as that may sound, we get caught
     up in the hustle and bustle of life and sometimes forget that the things
     that are filling our time won't truly matter in a few days, weeks, months,
     or even years. There are many things I have just taken for granted that I
     now count as opportunities rather than obligations.  There were many
     things that I had lost focus of that I regained thanks to 2020.  Mark
     11:24 states:  ¨<span style='background:white'>Therefore I tell you,
     whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will
     be yours.¨  I believe that through my prayers, God has allowed me to see
     what really matters and focus more on that.  </span></span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>More
     prayer time</span></b><span lang=EN>.  Prayer time is always important. 
     2020 allowed us to have more time to pray without ceasing.  Rather than
     rushing out the door in the mornings, there was more time to slowly sip
     that cup of coffee while praying for our country, our homes, and our
     friends.  James 5:16 tells us:  ¨<span style='background:white'>Therefore,
     confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be
     healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is
     working.¨</span></span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>Sure,
we can all list some things or sadly even someone we lost in 2020.  The adverse
impacts of 2020 were overwhelming, but how great is it to know that even amidst
such tragedy, we serve the Almighty King who holds the whole world in His
Hands.  As we go through 2021, may we continue to make time for what is truly
important.  </span></p>
