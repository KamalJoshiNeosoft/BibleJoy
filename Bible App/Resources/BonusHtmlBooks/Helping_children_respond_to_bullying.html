<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span lang=EN>Helping
Children Respond to Bullying </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>One of the most painful things we
face as parents is when our children are hurting. All too often, this hurt is
the result of bullying. Bullying can occur anywhere and can be defined as
repeated offenses to an individual. These can be in the form of physical
attacks, harsh words exchanged aloud or via text messages, or some other
behaviors that seek to taunt and ridicule someone. What does the Bible say
about responding to bullying?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>            While the word ‘bullying’ is
nowhere in the Bible, there are several key verses that remind us how to treat
other people and where to turn to help.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>            Follow these helpful tips to
direct your child on how to respond to bullying: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Be strong.</span></b><span lang=EN>  2
     Timothy 1:7 states: “For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and
     love and self-control.”  In this verse, we see God’s reminder that we are
     supposed to be strong.  Now, it can be hard when bullying is attacking our
     very identity, but even that is rooted in Christ and His love.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Take the high road.</span></b><span
     lang=EN>  Romans 8:37 states: “No, in all these things we are more than
     conquerors through him who loved us.”  Winning with a bully is simply that
     we don’t need to attempt.  Rather than looking at how to win, try to lift
     the person up in prayer.  This can be so hard, but doing so could render
     eternal results.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>God will meet our needs.</span></b><span
     lang=EN>  “And my God will supply every need of yours according to his
     riches in glory in Christ Jesus.”  It is definitely hard to see bullying
     as a need, but maybe growing more assertive or learning when to reach out
     and help someone else is a by-product of being bullied.  Even during
     adversity, God is with us, and it could be that He is growing up to do
     bigger things for Him during this difficult season.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Be a witness. </span></b><span lang=EN> When
     our kids are hurting, we want to lash out, retaliate, and fix things, but
     this is not always possible.  Instead be a calm source of encouragement,
     wisdom, and redirection to the cross.  Romans 8:16 says, “The Spirit
     himself bears witness with our spirit that we children of God.”  As His
     children, we have a duty to direct others to Christ.  Even during these
     trying times, remain faithful in prayer.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Seek His promise of protection</span></b><span
     lang=EN>.  Fixing bullying is simply not something that can be easily
     done.  Sure, steps must be taken to report bullying, but don’t let the
     other people involved become the primary focus.  Seek Him, and follow
     David’s wisdom when He says to see the Lord while he may be found.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The Lord will not allow the righteous to be
shaken.  Use this difficult time to teach your child the proper way to deal
with conflict.  In other words: pray, report bullying to the proper
authorities, maintain a calm attitude, and redirect your child to positive
areas in their life.  </span></p>
