<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>Romans
5:8 states,¨<span style='background:white'>But God shows his love for us in
that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.¨How amazing is this
verse? Jesus Christ loved each of us reading this enough to die for us before
we were ever born. Before we ever set foot on this Earth, He had already made
a way for us to spend eternity in Heaven with Him. This affirmation should be
enough to dismiss the lies that the enemy so cunningly speaks. There are many
lies he wants us to believe, but we have to take root in God's Word so we do
not listen to these lies.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222;

importantly, let's look at what God says about these lies.</span></p>

     style='background:white'>Lie #1:  You are NOT enough</span></b><span
     lang=EN style='background:white'>.  How many times have you thought that
     you were not enough?  You let the lies creep in and start to focus on how
     much better of a father/mother, sister/brother, aunt/uncle, child, friend,
     and the list goes on and on that you should be.  Friend, until we make it
     home to Heaven, there will always be room for improvement, but God has
     said that you are enough!  2 Corinthians 12:9 states, ¨But he said to me,
     “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in
     weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so
     that the power of Christ may rest upon me.¨  During the times when you
     feel like less, lean on Him more.  He wants to be your strength, your
     shield, and your comfort.  Friend, you are enough!  God says so!  </span></li>

     style='background:white'>Lie #2:  You have made too many mistakes.</span></b><span
     lang=EN style='background:white'>  Regardless of your past sin, we are all
     sinners.  When we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, we become
     sinners saved by grace.  You have not made too many mistakes for Christ to
     clean you up, change you, and make you part of His Kingdom.  He paid the
     ultimate price because you are enough!  Matthew 10:31 states, ¨Fear not,
     therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.¨  When the enemy
     steps up in your face, remind him who you are and that you are forgiven. 
     Your past sins are forgiven.  Psalms 103 reminds us that our sins are
     forgiven as far as the East is from the West.  </span></li>

     lang=EN style='background:white'>God blessed each of us with unique
     talents.  Some of us are teachers, some are great speakers.  Some of us
     are able to show compassion for those in need while others are better
     suited for working in the background organizing and preparing others to go
     out and do on site work.  The statement ´God does not call the equipped,
     he equips the called is so true.  You will have whatever you need when He
     calls you.  1 Peter 4:10 states, ¨As each has received a gift, use it to
     serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace¨.  Furthermore,
     Romans 12:6 reads:  Having gifts that differ according to the grace given
     to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith.¨  Pray
     without ceasing.  Seek His will, HIs purpose, and where He wants you to
     be.  When you find your place, you will find that your talents are great.

price.  A price that is far more valuable than anything we can obtain in this
world.  Seek your value in HIm and know that God's truth and many blessings do
not align with the lies that the enemy tries to bombard you with.  </span></p>
