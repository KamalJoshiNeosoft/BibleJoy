<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>5 Life
Lessons from the Book of Joshua</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>What lessons can we learn from the sixth book
in the Old Testament? The book of Joshua takes readers into Israel’s story
following the conquest of Canaan. Let’s take a look at five key lessons that
are evidenced throughout this text.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN> <b>Evil does exist, but God’s power is
     sufficient to defeat it. </b>In Joshua 1:5-8, readers meet Joshua who has
     become the Israelites’ new leader. Joshua had every right to be afraid or
     discouraged with so many people there. He did not allow the present evil
     to fill him with weakness.  Instead, Joshua focused on what the Lord had
     promised him.  Through Joshua’s belief in God’s power, he was armed with
     strength and knowledge to defeat the enemy.  What enemies do you need to
     surrender today, so that you can take full advantage of God’s presence and
     commitment in your life.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>With God, there is always a way.</span></b><span
     lang=EN>  There are times in life that people we truly believed cared
     about abandon us or let us down, but God will never be one of these
     individuals.  He is with us through every circumstance and trial.  In
     Joshua 3:9-17, we see firsthand how God was able to work within the land
     of Canaan.  Through obedience, the Israelites watched the Jordan River
     split, so they could cross.  The Israelites would have thought there was
     no way, but God made a way.  He will make a way for us when it seems that
     there is no way.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Practice Patience.</span></b><span
     lang=EN>  In Joshua 6:1-5, the Israelites are walking around the city of
     Jericho.  Their minds are focused on going to battle.  They feel this is
     needed, but Joshua told them to be quiet.  It was through his obedience to
     follow the Lord’s instructions, the Israelites kept marching.  After
     marching around the city for six days and then marching seven times on the
     seventh day, they blew their trumpets and the walls came tumbling down. 
     How many times do we not know God’s full plan, so we are non-compliant? 
     How differently would things have been if Joshua hadn’t heeded the Lord’s
     instructions?  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Stay Focused.</span></b><span lang=EN> 
     Throughout the book of Joshua, we see time and time again the need for
     perseverance.  Remaining focused was necessary.  Keeping a focus on God
     and His instructions was necessary.  We must stay focused and not lose
     heart when things get hard.  </span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>Don’t Accept Defeat!</span></b><span
     lang=EN>  Rather than choosing to run, Joshua chose over and over again to
     stay.  He did not allow fear or weakness to lead him away from God’s
     battle plan.  Stay focused on God’s plan - don’t accept defeat.  </span></li>
