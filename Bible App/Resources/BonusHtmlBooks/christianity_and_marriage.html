and Marriage(especially during these times)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='color:#222222;background:white'>Genesis
2:18 says, “Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be
alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='color:#222222;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='color:#222222;background:white'>Found
in the first book of the Old Testament, we are reminded of how beautiful
marriage is. The opportunity to share life with someone is a beautiful thing,
but with it can come many challenges. The changing world, the current
pandemic, and the stressors that each of those creates can cause anxieties to
increase.  What are some productive ways to maintain a healthy marriage with a
Christian focus even during these trying times?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='color:#222222;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222'><span lang=EN style='background:
     white'>Stop emphasizing productivity - focus instead on faithfulness. 
     Times are hard right now.  This is history in the making; routines are
     changed which can result in working from home, trying to homeschool
     children who want to see their friends, and an abundance of time that can
     be hard to fill.  Rather than trying to measure the success of your day
     based on how much you accomplished, look at how you and your spouse are
     getting through this time together.  Galatians 5:22 states:  “The fruit of
     the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
     faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.”  Withhold judgment from your
     spouse and instead choose to celebrate these traits that your marriage
     reflects.</span></li>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222'><span lang=EN style='background:
     white'>Put your trust in God.  There are so many misleading things in the
     news today or filtering through social media.  Uncertainty between spouses
     on how to protect yourselves and your family can cause tension.  Make wise
     choices, but the best choice of all is to put your trust in God.  Stay
     focused on Christ and His wisdom.  Set aside daily time to seek His word
     together and pray for guidance and wisdom during this trying time.  ‘For
     the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God
     is stronger than human strength” (1 Corinthians 1:25).  </span></li>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222'><span lang=EN style='background:
     white'>Be humble.  Spending more and more time with someone in close
     proximity can minimize healthy separation, but we can seek to maintain
     humbleness.  When working from home or trying to help kids learn some new
     content, frustration may emerge.  Selfishness may temporarily reveal
     itself.  During these times when frustrations cause ugliness to shine,
     practice repentance and humility.  Work together to identify the problem
     and look for compromising solutions.  </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222'><span lang=EN style='background:
     white'>Encourage each other.  Spouses are a team.  Make it a point to
     encourage each other with a kind note, a small gift, or completing chores
     around the house that often go undone.  Share Bible verses that uplift and
     encourage your spouse.  The ways to encourage each other are endless, but
     the importance of such gestures is priceless.  </span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='color:#222222;background:white'>Throughout
this pandemic and into the future, you and your spouse are a team.  You face a
common enemy.  Work together to remind each other of what is true, worthy of
praise, and commendable.  Seek to build a life founded on Scripture, celebrated
through worship, empowered through prayer, and uplifted by each other’s
encouragement.  </span></p>
