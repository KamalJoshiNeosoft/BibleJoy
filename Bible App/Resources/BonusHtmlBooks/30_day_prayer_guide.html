truly God has listened; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.” When we
pray, it is not just about asking God for things we need or desire. We should
spend time communicating with Him the same way we communicate with our family
and friends. To create a meaningful relationship with God, we should have
conversations with Him that show our commitment and desire for a more personal
relationship with Him. Our world is filled with confusion, worry, strife, and
uncertainty, so this 30-day prayer guide is meant to help you create a more
effective prayer life.</span></p>
