lang=EN style='color:#222222'>5 Tips about Asking for Forgiveness</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;background:white'><span
lang=EN style='color:#222222'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>In
the Bible, the words <i>forgive</i> and <i>forgiveness </i>are found dozens of
times. In fact, depending on the translation, it is there well over a hundred
times. In Ephesians 4:32, the Bible reminds us:  ¨Be kind to one another,
tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.¨</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>While
we know that forgiveness is something we are told to do throughout our lives,
it can be difficult.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>Pray,
     pray, pray …. Forgiveness is hard</span></b><span lang=EN>.Sometimes
     people ask us to forgive them before our hearts are ready. Other times,
     people never ask, but that does not mean we simply get to choose to harbor
     those hard feelings. Pray and ask Godś direction in guiding your heart
     towards forgiveness. Be open with God and allow Him to show you how to
     lay this burden down.</span></li>
</ol>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>Don´t
     make it about the other person</span></b><span lang=EN>.  Depending on the
     grievance, some people spend months or even years sorting through their
     feelings and walking around with feelings of unforgiveness.  In my own
     life, there have been times that I clung to those feelings because I
     firmly believed that forgiving the other person would somehow let them off
     the hook.  Remember that forgiveness is a private matter that frees your
     heart and rids you of the anger and sin that is mentioned in Ephesians 4:
     ¨Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and
     give no opportunity to the devil.¨</span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>Seek
     help. </span></b><span lang=EN> There have been times in my life when I
     have been so hurt that I just didn't know where or how to begin.  At these
     times. I have sought counsel from other Christians.  Sometimes the devil
     wants to keep these matters hidden so he can bind our joy.  We should seek
     help and clarity, so that the darkness is brought into the light.  </span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>Be
     honest.</span></b><span lang=EN>  Communication is a vital part of any
     relationship.  If possible, set aside some time for real, meaningful
     conversations with the person(s) you need to forgive.  This may not be
     easy, but it is in direct obedience to Matthew 18:15:  ¨“If your brother
     sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If
     he listens to you, you have gained your brother.¨</span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:#222222;background:white'><b><span lang=EN>Wait.</span></b><span
     lang=EN>  This can be one of the hardest things to do.  Sometimes when we
     hurt someone, we can offer an apology, but they may not be able to receive
     it just yet.  Allow them to have the time and space they need.  Pray for
     them, but respect their wishes.  </span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='color:#222222'>Asking
for forgiveness requires that your heart be ready.  This reason is why praying
and seeking other people´s help can inspire and encourage the process of
forgiving.  Choosing to forgive may be easier at times than others, but it also
comes with celebration based on what God wants us to do to remain in harmony
with others and allow our light to shine.  </span></p>
